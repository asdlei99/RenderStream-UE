![alt text](https://download.disguise.one/media/6066/d3-renderstream-unreal.png)

This project provides RenderStream input from Unreal Engine to [disguise designer](https://www.disguise.one/en/products/designer/).

For the plugin setup process - please visit the [RenderStream and Unreal Engine](https://help.disguise.one/Content/Configuring/Render-engines/RenderStream-Unreal.htm) page for more details.

A **Demo Unreal Project** can be found on the [disguise Resources page](https://download.disguise.one/#resources)

_Please note that from version 1.26 onwards, the plugin has been renamed from "disguiseuerenderstream" to "RenderStream-UE". Existing Unreal projects will need to be updated to reflect this._
